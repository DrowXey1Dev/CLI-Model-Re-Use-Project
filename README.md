This analyzer is a CLI tool designed to analyze GitHub and NPM repositories and calculate important metrics that reflect the repository's health. Specifically, it calculates:
  - Bus Factor: A measure of how many key contributors are needed to achieve 50% of the total commits.
  - Correctness
  - Ramp Up: A score out of 10 that estimates how easy it is to understand and contribute to the project based on the presence of documentation and the number of open issues.
